Our Mission
-----------

At <cite>Midnight Breakfast</cite>, we’re looking for writing that will spark a conversation. We want to bring you back to late-night talks with good friends over greasy food. We are excited by fiction, personal essays, cultural criticism, and interviews. We believe in the serious, but we also believe that if you can’t make people laugh, you don’t deserve to make them think. We believe in craft and passion, and we want to support a community of artists that care about these things too. By paying our contributors, we show respect for the process and the challenge of creating original, dynamic work. Let’s share the intriguing and the humorous and the meaningful. Let’s sate our appetite. Let’s go for the gut.
